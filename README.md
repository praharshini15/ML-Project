Lung Cancer CT Classifier

This project is a Flask-based web application that classifies lung CT scan images into categories such as Benign Lung Tumor, Malignant Lung Tumor, and Normal Lung Tissue using a deep learning model trained with TensorFlow/Keras.  

The app provides a simple browser-based interface where users can upload CT scan images and instantly receive classification results.

Features
- Upload CT scan images through a web interface  
- Preprocessing pipeline for images (resize, normalize, batch)  
- Deep learning model for classification  
- Displays predicted class with confidence score  
- Lightweight Flask application
